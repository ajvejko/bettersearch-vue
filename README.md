# bettersearch-react

This project is a personal learning project where I experiment with new technologies such as React and Tailwind. <br/>
The goal of BetterSearch is to provide a faster and more efficient way to search the web by allowing users to set custom shortcuts for their favorite websites.

## How to use

1. Add a custom site by clicking on the `+` button in the top left corner. 
2. Input your desired home link (example: `https://www.youtube.com/`) and search link (example: `https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=`). 
3. Now you can search on that site by inputting your desired search term in the search bar and selecting the corresponding button.
4. To use the home link the search bar must be empty when trying to search with a selected button, this acts as a shortcut.
5. You can also search on google by not selecting any button and just press enter.
- To edit or delete a button, hold shift and click on the button.

## To-Do

- Add a way to easily copy and paste button configs from localStorage
- Make my own extension for custom new tab.
- Add a tutorial on how to use the site.
